Currently in a pre-release development phase.

## Introduction

### GhostCompute is an Essential API Framework for Cloud Privacy and Security

Develop secure applications using a free open-source backend API framework built with excessive simplicity.

### Build and Orchestrate Powerful Cloud Applications the Right Way

Use built-in API actions to automate deployment, monitoring and scaling for sensitive network infrastructure in containerless Linux environments without sacrificing performance, privacy or security. 

GhostCompute is a backend API framework for cloud applications as well as a standalone automation system for controlling cloud network infrastructure from the same API.

### Make Clean API Requests to a Single Endpoint in JSON Format

#### Request Example

```json
{
    "action": "add_node",
    "authentication_token": "123456789",
    "data": {
        "external_ip_address_version_4": "0.0.0.0",
        "internal_ip_address_version_4": "10.10.10.10"
    }
}
'''

#### Response Example

{
    "data": {
        "id": "unique_id_1",
        [ ... ]
    },
    "message": "Node added successfully.",
    "status_authenticated": "1",
    "status_valid": "1"
}

### Transform Servers Into Automated Nodes Programmatically

Remove complexity from these server-side components while adding valuable functionality with API automation.

### Write Better Backend Code for Cloud Applications

There shouldn't be a learning curve for developers when designing secure backend cloud systems at scale.
