## NodeCompute

`NodeCompute is currently in a pre-release development phase and is likely to contain errors during development.`

`Production systems shouldn't be deployed until version 1 is released with system update functionality from the API.`

### A Scalable Cloud Node Automation API

[NodeCompute](https://github.com/twexxor/nodecompute/) is a free and open-source API to automate deployment, monitoring and scaling of containerless network infrastructure.

Complexity is removed for maximum performance, privacy and security with a custom [PHP framework](https://github.com/twexxor/nodecompute/blob/main/system_databases.php).
